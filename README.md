## Compatibility

SharpGL has built in support for OpenGL support, newer functions can be loaded on demand as needed. The table below shows the compatibility across frameworks and platforms.

**OpenGL**

Currently SharpGL has built in bindings for **OpenGL 4.0** - functions from later versions can be loaded at runtime as needed.

**Framework Compatibility**

All components support the .NET Framework 4.0 onwards, .NET Core 3.0 onwards and .NET Standard 2.1 onwards. Some components also support earlier versions.

| Component | .NET Framework | .NET Core | .NET Standard |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| `SharpGL` | 4.0+ | 2.0+ | 2.0+ |
| `SharpGL.SceneGraph` | 4.0+ | 2.0+ | 2.0+ |
| `SharpGL.Serialization` | 4.0+ | 2.0+ | 2.0+ |
| `SharpGL.WinForms` | 4.0+ | 3.0+ | 2.1+ |
| `SharpGL.WPF` | 4.0+ | 3.0+ | 2.1+ |

**Platform Comptability**

Compatability across platforms is supported via framework specific components.

| Platform | Support       |
|----------|---------------|
| WinForms on Microsoft Windows | ✅ via `SharpGL.WinForms` |
| WPF on Microsoft Windows | ✅ via `SharpGL.WPF` |
| UWP on Microsoft Windows | ❌ Work in Progress |
| Xamarin on Microsoft Windows | ❌ Work in Progress |
| Xamarin on MacOS | ❌ Work in Progress |
| Xamarin on Linux | ❌ Work in Progress |

**Legacy Versions**

The Visual Studio 2017 version of the codebase, which supports the .NET Framework only, is available on the `release/2.x` branch. However, this branch will _not_ be maintained going forwards. The current mainline still supports the .NET Framework.

## Developer Guide

To build the code, clone the repo and open the SharpGL, Samples or Tools solution. The Extensions solution is used for the Visual Studio Project Templates and requires additional components - you can find out more on the Wiki on the '[Developing SharpGL](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpgl/wiki/Developing-SharpGL)' page.

You can also use the following scripts to run the processes:

| Script         | Notes                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config.ps1`   | Ensure your machine can run builds by installing necessary components such as `nunit`. Should only need to be run once. |
| `build.ps1`    | Build all solutions. Ensures that we build both 32/64 bit versions of native components.                                |
| `test.ps1`     | Run all tests, including those in samples.                                                                              |
| `coverage.ps1` | Create a coverage report. Reports are written to `./artifacts/coverage`                                                 |
| `pack.ps1`     | Create all of the SharpGL NuGet packages, which are copied to `./artifacts/packages`.                                   |

These scripts will generate various artifacts which may be useful to review:

```
artifacts\
  \tests                  # NUnit Test Reports
  \coverage               # Coverage Reports
  \packages               # NuGet Packages
```

### Releasing

To make and publish a release:

1. Update the `*.csproj` files with the new version number
2. Create the version tag (e.g. `git tag v3.2.1`)
3. Push the code and tags (e.g. `git push --follow-tags`)

AppVeyor will automatically push the release to NuGet and GitHub.

## Sample Applications

There are a large number of sample applications that show how to use SharpGL. Check out the 'Samples' solution to see the samples that are available.
